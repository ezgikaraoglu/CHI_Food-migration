Continue to layer 8-9 more phyllo sheets on top, \n brushing each sheet with butter until 10 sheets of phyllo have been stacked in the bottom of the baking dish. \n Sprinkle 1/2 of the chopped pistachios over the phyllo base in an even layer. \n Repeat the process to create another 8-10 sheet layer of phyllo and butter, \n followed by the remaining 1/2 of the nuts, and another top layer made up of the remaining phyllo sheets and butter. \n Slice into 36 pieces with a sharp knife, making sure to always cut through all layers of phyllo. \n Bake for 60 minutes, until the top is golden brown, and the bottom phyllo layers are baked through. \n Use a knife to lift up a corner of one of the rectangles to see if the bottom layers are done. \n Check the baklava after 40 minutes and cover with a piece of foil over the top if the baklava is getting too browned. \n When the baklava is done, remove from oven and slowly pour the cold syrup over the hot baklava. \n The syrup will likely bubble up and some may even overflow. \n Sprinkle the top of each piece of baklava with the remaining finely chopped pistachios. \n Let the baklava cool completely before serving at room temperature.","Occasion": "Religious holidays, family gatherings, after friendly football games :)","Dietary Choice": "Vegetarian","Source": "NYT","PhotoLink": "assets/img/photos/BKL001.jpg"}, "geometry": { "type": "Point","coordinates": [32.860431426982316, 39.92312918678572] } },
{"type": "Feature", "id": 3, "properties": {"AlternativeName": "Baklawa", "Ingredients": "Phyllo sheets: \n Use the 9×14 package with one pound of phyllo split into 2 packages of 20 sheets. \n Clarified Butter or Ghee: \n While you might be tempted to just use butter, clarified butter is best in this case because it’s essentially \n the fat component of butter without the liquid part that can create a soggy baklava. \n You’ll get a more golden color and more crisp texture. \n Walnuts: Walnuts are traditionally used to make the recipe, but you can use other types of nuts like pistachios, \n which are very popular ingredient in Middle Eastern sweets. \n Sugar: I use cane sugar in most of my desserts, so that’s what I mix with the walnuts here. \n You can use regular white sugar or coconut sugar, but go for something granulated and not liquid for best texture. \n Simple Syrup: This is basically sugar cooked down with water to form a liquid sauce to pour over the baklava. \n We add lemon juice and orange blossom water to give it that unique Lebanese flavor. \n This simple syrup is the prime distinction of Lebanese baklawa from other variations.","Recipe": " Place a layer of phyllo pastry sheets in the bottom of a prepared and greased pan. \n Add the mixture of crushed walnuts and sugar evenly on top, smoothening out with a spatula. \n Add the rest of the phyllo sheets carefully on top. \n Cut into diamonds and pour over the clarified butter.
