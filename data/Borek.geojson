{"type": "Feature", "id": 1, "properties": {"AlternativeName": "Borek","Ingredients": "Dough: 1 package of Yufka pastry sheets ¼ cup Plant-based milk + 2 tbsp oil (to brush) Black cumin, nigella, sesame seeds (optional for topping) Potato filling: 1 kg Potatoes 1 Onion 150 mL Plant-based milk 40 g Parsley 1 tsp Apple cider Vinegar 1 tbsp Olive oil ⅛ tsp Cayenne (optional) Salt / pepper to taste cheese you like (optional)","Recipe": "1Potato filling 1. Wash and peel the potato. Cut it into large chunks and steam until fork tender. Reserve aside. 2. Meanwhile, cut the onion into small cubes and sautee the onion on low/medium heat during 10 minutes. 3. Mash the potato completely and add cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. 4. Add the milk, olive oil, vinegar, and chopped parsley and stir. Roll Börek 1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (360°F) top and bottom heat. 2. First, carefully unfold the filo sheets. Attention, they tear apart easily (it's not a big deal if so). Use a pair of scissors to cut the dough sheets into halves. 3. Place a triangle-shaped or rectangle-shaped yufka dough on a clean surface, with the wide side facing you (in case of a triangle). Moisten the edges with a wet brush. This will help the edges to stick while rolling. 4. Add one to two tablespoons of filling two centimeters away from the wide edge, leaving 2 cm on each side then roll one time. 5. Fold the outer corners over and roll the borek tightly. Set aside and continue with the remaining yufka and filling. 6. If you want to make a spiral, oil a pie dish and put the filled dough sausage into the oiled form. Try to hold it as stable as possible, because it breaks easily. Start with the outer edge and gradually lay out the spiral until the shape is completely laid out like a snail. 7. Brush the borek with the soy milk/oil mixture and sprinkle with black cumin and sesame seeds. 8. Bake in the oven (180°C - 360°F) for about 30 minutes, until the borek has turned golden brown and crispy. 9. Serve and enjoy!","Occasion": "Casual tea time, breakfast","Dietary Choice": "Vegetarian, Vegan","Source": "Sevinc Karaoglu","PhotoLink": "https://foto.haberler.com/haber/2020/11/25/borek-tarifleri-en-lezzetli-borek-tarifleri-13758966_5753_o.jpg"}, "geometry": { "type": "Point","coordinates": [32.860431426982316, 39.92312918678572] } }
