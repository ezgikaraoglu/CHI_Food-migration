{"type": "Feature", "id": 8, "properties": {"AlternativeName": "Revani","Ingredients": "Cake: 4 Eggs, 9 Table spoon (TBS) of sugar, \n 6 TBS of yoghurt, 10 TBS of flour, \n 2 TBS of semolina, 2 bags of baking powder/Syrup \n 3,5 glass of sugar 4 glasses of water Â½ lemon (juiced) \n Garnishing: Coconut Ground nuts","Recipe": "1. Preheat the oven to 350 F (175 C). Grease a 9-inch by 13-inch baking pan. \n Before you start making the cake, prepare the syrup to give it time to cool down. \n Begin by mixing the sugar and water in a medium saucepan. \n Turn the heat on high and bring the mixture to a boil while continuously stirring it. \n Once it boils, reduce the heat to low and let the syrup boil gently for about 10 minutes with the cover off. \n Add the lemon juice toward the end. Turn off the heat and let the syrup cool down while you make the rest of the recipe. \n In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. \n Whisk the mixture briskly for several minutes until the sugar dissolves. \n The more you whisk, the better your revani will turn out. \n Add the oil, lemon zest, vanilla, and yogurt and whisk for several minutes more. \n Add the dry ingredients and mix together well until you have a smooth batter. \n Pour the batter into the greased baking pan. \n Bake until the top is nicely browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 to 40 minutes. \n Once you remove the pan from the oven, let it rest for about 5 minutes. \n Cut the cake into portion-sized squares or rectangles while still in the pan. \n Using a large spoon, slowly drizzle all of the cooled syrup over the cake and let it soak in. \n Cover the cake with foil and refrigerate it for several hours. \n Before serving, garnish each square of cake with a pinch of coconut and ground nuts.","Occasion": "All time fav, holiday gatherings, family dinners","Dietary Choice": "","Source": "Naciye Umit Erten","PhotoLink": "assets/img/photos/BSB001.jpg"}, "geometry": { "type": "Point","coordinates": [69.1776838, 34.5260109] } }
