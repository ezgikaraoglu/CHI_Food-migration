{"type": "Feature", "id": 0, "properties": {"AlternativeName": "Sarma, Dolma","Ingredients": " 1 jar grape leaves about 60-70 in brine \n 2 cups short grain rice \n 1 large tomato finely chopped (about 3/4 cup) \n 1 bunch parsley finely chopped (about 1/2 cup) \n 1 bunch green onions finely chopped (about 1/2 cup) \n ¼ green pepper finely chopped (about 1/4 cup) \n 1 tablespoon minced garlic \n 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper or to taste Salt and pepper to taste \n ¾ cup olive oil divided \n 1 large tomato sliced \n ¾ cup lemon juice","Recipe": " Prep Grape Leaves & Stuffing \n Remove the grape leaves from the jar, and soak them in a large bowl of boiling hot water for a few minutes. \n Drain the grape leaves in a colander and stack them on a plate. \n Combine the rice, tomatoes, parsley, green onions, green peppers, garlic and crushed red pepper. \n Season with salt and pepper and drizzle 1/4 cup of the olive oil over the mixture. \n Toss well to combine. Stuff & Wrap Grape Leaves To stuff and roll the grape leaves, \n lay a grape leaf flat on a cutting board, scoop out a heaping teaspoon of the rice mixture into the center of the grape leaf. \n Carefully fold in the sides and roll it like you would when making a wrap. \n Repeat until all the stuffing has been used and place the wrapped grape leaves on a tray while wrapping. \n It will make about 60 rolls. Cook the Stuffed Grape Leaves. \n Line the bottom of a large pot with tomatoes and season with salt/pepper. \n Neatly arrange the stuffed and rolled grape leaves in rows, alternating directions, \n to completely cover the circumference of the pot. \n Make sure to tightly pack them in the pot to prevent them from floating up and unwrapping during cooking. \n Drizzle each layer with some of the remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. \n Place a plate upside down on top of the grape leaves in the pot. \n Next use something to weigh it down (a second plate works well or a bowl full of water). \n This will hold down the grape leaves in place, and prevent floating while they are cooking. \n Add enough water (about 5-6 cups) to completely cover the grape leaves and the plate. \n Then cover the pot and cook on medium heat for 30 minutes, until most of the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked. \n Add the lemon juice on top of the grape leaves, then cook on low heat for an additional 45 minutes. \n Remove from heat and let rest for 30 minutes. Transfer to a dish and enjoy warm or at room temperature.","Occasion": "","Dietary Choice": "Vegan, Vegetarian","Source": "Sevinc Karaoglu","PhotoLink": "assets/img/photos/DM001.JPG"}, "geometry": { "type": "Point","coordinates": [38.4147331, 27.1434119] } }
