(This step helps the lentils to keep their shape and texture). \n Add water, turn heat up and bring it to a boil, add salt, then turn it to a medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes. \n When the lentils are tender but still mostly hold their shape, stir in fresh chopped cilantro and take it off the heat.\n", "Source": "Vikalinka by Julia Frey", "WebLink": "https://vikalinka.com/nepalese-red-lentil-dahl/", "PhotoLink": "https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Red-Lentil-Dahl-8-Edit.jpg"}, "geometry": { "type": "Point","coordinates": [84.1240, 28.3949] } }
